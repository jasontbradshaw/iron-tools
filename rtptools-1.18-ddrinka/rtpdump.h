/*
* rtpdump file format
*
* The file starts with the tool to be used for playing this file,
* the multicast/unicast receive address and the port.
*
* #!rtpplay1.0 224.2.0.1/3456\n
*
* This is followed by one binary header (RD_hdr_t) and one RD_packet_t
* structure for each received packet.  All fields are in network byte
* order.  We don't need the source IP address since we can do mapping
* based on SSRC.  This saves (a little) space, avoids non-IPv4
* problems and privacy/security concerns. The header is followed by
* the RTP/RTCP header and (optionally) the actual payload.
